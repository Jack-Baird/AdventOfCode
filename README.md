# AdventOfCode
A collection of my attempts at the *awesome* [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).

## File Structure
Files are structured and named as follows:
```
2020
 ┣ D01
 ┃ ┣ AoC-2020-D01-P1.py
 ┃ ┣ AoC-2020-D01-P2.py
 ┃ ┗ D01-Input.txt
 ┣ D02
 ┃ ┣ AoC-2020-D02-P1.py
 ┃ ┣ AoC-2020-D02-P2.py
 ┃ ┗ D02-Input.txt
 ┣ D03
 ┃ ┣ AoC-2020-D03-P1.py
 ┃ ┣ AoC-2020-D03-P2.py
 ┃ ┗ D03-Input.txt
 ```

 ## Other scripts etc
 There are a few other python files floating loosely around in the root directory; these are utilities I've written for performing file / folder manipulation (renaming, re-structuring etc) and need collating into one program. My grand plan is that at the start of each AoC, I can run one program to produce the full skeleton file structure and then (ideally<sup>1</sup>) have it fetch the input each day automatically.

 <sup>1</sup>This is dependant more on whether the time / benefit trade-off is worthwhile than if I can actually pull it off!
